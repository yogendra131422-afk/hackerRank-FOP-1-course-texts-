Looping problems and solutions 
1.Looping - Adam’s Charity
Adam runs a small charity organization. Every month, he collects donations from several donors.
He wants to calculate the total amount collected, the average donation, and identify the highest and lowest donations

solution :
n = int(input())

total_coins = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    total_coins += i * i

print(total_coins)





2.Looping - Car Speed
A traffic monitoring system records the speed of several cars passing through a highway checkpoint. 
The system needs to analyze the data to help the traffic police.

solution :
N = int(input())

total = 0
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    if N % i == 0:
        total += i

print(total)




3.Looping - Quality Check for Premium Products
A company manufactures premium electronic products. Each product must pass a quality check test before it is approved for sale.
The test assigns each product a quality score (between 0 and 100).

solution :
N = int(input())

if N <= 1:
    print("Regular Product")
elif N == 2:
    print("Premium Product")
elif N % 2 == 0:
    print("Regular Product")
else:
    is_prime = True
    for i in range(3, int(N**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if N % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
    
    if is_prime:
        print("Premium Product")
    else:
        print("Regular Product")





4.Looping - Coding Marathon
A college is organizing a Coding Marathon event where several students participate to test their programming skills.
Each participant solves a certain number of problems within a given time.
The event coordinator wants to analyze the results to understand overall performance.

solution :
N = int(input())
K = int(input())
marks = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Sort marks in descending order
marks.sort(reverse=True)

# Sum the top K marks
top_k_sum = sum(marks[:K])

print(top_k_sum)





5.Looping - Inventory Check for Rare Items
A museum maintains a special inventory of rare items. Each item has a uniqueness score
(ranging from 1 to 100) that indicates how rare or valuable it is.
The museum curator wants to analyze the collection and categorize the items based on their uniqueness scores.

solution :
import math

N = int(input())

# Calculate sum of factorials of digits
sum_factorials = 0
for digit in str(N):
    sum_factorials += math.factorial(int(digit))

# Check if it's a Strong Number
if sum_factorials == N:
    print("Rare Item")
else:
    print("Common Item")
